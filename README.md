# Road_Accidents_Analysis
My task was to design a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze road safety data. 📊 With my knowledge, I was able to successfully complete the project.
The process involved:

Data Preparation: Cleaning and transforming the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key trends and patterns in accident data, such as accident severity distribution and accidents over time.

Dashboard Design: Creating an interactive and user-friendly dashboard with visualizations to effectively communicate insights.

KPIs: Developing meaningful Key Performance Indicators to monitor road safety, including the number of accidents over time, distribution by day of the week, and the impact of weather conditions on accident severity.

This task was a fantastic opportunity to apply my skills in data analysis and visualization to a real-world problem. I'm confident that these skills will be a valuable asset in future impactful projects. 💪
